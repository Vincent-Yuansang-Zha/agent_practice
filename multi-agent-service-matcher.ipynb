    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Agent Pipeline** - A sequential chain of three specialized LLM-powered agents\n",
    "2. **Custom Tool** - A function that provides data to agents\n",
    "3. **In-Memory Session State** - A mechanism for agents to share context and pass information forward\n",

    "### What is Session State?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Session state** is a shared memory space where agents store and retrieve information during a single execution run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need it?**\n",
    "- Agents need to **communicate**: Agent 2 needs Agent 1's output\n",
    "- Agents need **context**: Each agent builds on previous work\n",
    "- We need **transparency**: We can inspect what each agent produced\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Implementation: Python Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a simple Python dictionary as our session state:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "session = {\n",
    "    \"user_request\": \"original request\",           # Input from user\n",
    "    \"clarified_request\": \"...\",                   # Agent 1 writes this\n",
    "    \"matched_service\": {...},                      # Agent 2 writes this\n",

    "**Key Principle**: Each agent:\n",
    "1. Reads what it needs from the session\n",
    "2. Does its work (usually an LLM call)\n",
    "3. Writes its output back to the session\n",
    "4. Returns the session for the next agent\n",

    "## 10. Key Takeaways and Learning Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've built a complete multi-agent system. Let's review what you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Multi-Agent Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: Multiple AI agents working together, each with a specific role\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: \n",
    "- Separation of concerns (each agent has one job)\n",
    "- Easier to debug and improve\n",
    "- More modular and maintainable\n",
    "\n",
    "**How**: \n",
    "- Define clear roles for each agent\n",
    "- Use prompts to give each agent its \"personality\"\n",
    "- Chain agents in a sequence (pipeline pattern)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Custom Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: Functions that agents can call to access data or perform actions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: \n",
    "- LLMs can't access external data without tools\n",
    "- Tools provide reliable, structured information\n",
    "- Tools extend what agents can do beyond text generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**How**: \n",
    "- Create simple functions that return data\n",
    "- Call tools in your agent code\n",
    "- Include tool output in prompts for LLM reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Session State Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: A shared memory space where agents store and retrieve information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: \n",
    "- Agents need to communicate\n",
    "- Each agent builds on previous work\n",
    "- Enables sequential processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**How**: \n",
    "- Use a dictionary to store state\n",
    "- Each agent reads from and writes to the session\n",
    "- Pass the session through the pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Pipeline Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**What**: A sequence of operations where output flows from one to the next\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why**: \n",
    "- Simple and predictable execution\n",
    "- Easy to reason about\n",
    "- Easy to extend or modify\n",
    "\n",
    "**How**: \n",
    "- Create functions for each stage\n",
    "- Each function takes state, modifies it, returns it\n",
    "- Orchestrate with a main function\n",
    "\n",

    "To deepen your learning, try these exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add a 4th agent**: Create a \"Validator\" that checks if the match quality is high enough\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Add more services**: Expand the service list to 10+ items and test edge cases\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Add a second tool**: Create `get_user_history()` that returns past requests, and use it in Agent 2\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Improve prompts**: Experiment with different prompt styles to improve matching accuracy\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Add error handling**: What happens if the LLM returns invalid JSON? Add try/catch blocks\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Parallel agents**: Research how to run multiple agents in parallel instead of sequentially\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. **Add confidence scores**: Have Agent 2 return a confidence score (0-100) with each match\n",
